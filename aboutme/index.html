              <p>Hello! My name is ^ and I love to do many things including maths. I'm currently a student but I make money moves with my top class drug dealing scheme operation.
                I'm the George W Bush of London, trust me. That's a joke for any Federal Entities reading this, I apologise.

              <p class="text-light">
                  There's nothing much about it. I was born and raised like a bear so now I'm the biggest bear around, rawrgh. (That's a bear sound!) I'm a very very bored 
                  individual as you can probably tell with nothing but time and knowledge on my mind. Well Darius, why don't you revise Maths or Physics like you're supposed to
                  and finally excel in your education? Listen Mr Teddy-Bear, I don't know why I do the things I do, life just moves on and on like the rats from ratatouille on their little
                  diy boats. Sometimes I wish I was a rat, their life seems very simplistic and minimalistic, despite the great threat and danger pretty much all other mammals set for them, 
                  humans have humans to fear, rats are always friends. I love trees, I think the complexity behind a tree yet it's simplistic look is wonderful, it makes my toes wiggle and my skin 
                  fold and wrinkle like an old little lady. I also love food, always have, probably always will, it's just something about it that makes my brain fizzle and pop like pop rock.

                  Despite describing myself as a bear, a soft to the touch creature with fuzzy and warm fur, I also behave like one sometimes which isn't necessarily what I want however,
                  evolution, am I right? I love my girlfriend though she's like a bear but a teddy-bear but like a baby-teddy-bear , a babybear. The girl next to me in the picture unfortunately isn't 
                  her, that's Chloe, my... friend. I talk to her and she's always my companion whenever I scream at people on Omegle.

                  All funny jokes aside, as hopefully previously mentioned before, somewhere on this site; This was made for fun and out of boredom, nothing on here is dead-to-the-bone serious, however 
                  mine and Ferdaus' relationship is. If you find this weird, useless or pointless, I wish you nothing but a 1x1 Lego piece stuck to the bottom of your inside eyelid. Anyway, on the topic
                  of Legos, I love,love,love,love Legos, they're amazing and they make me feel AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I'm like a child, except 4 times bigger than a child, it's scary. I enjoy coding, screaming,
                  getting angry and playing League of Legends. I'm using gym as a distraction from the depressing fact I've spent over Â£1000 on a free-to-play game :( . Please don't tell my mum, please!!
                  I, of course love and value all my friends and family, I only surround myself with people whom I see would support me through anything and any decision I would make and that's something
                  everyone should start doing. Friends are overrated, all you need is yourself and a very pretty girl or boy, if you swing that way. I have mine and I'm very happy. Also, don't do drugs kids,
                  but if you do, shout me on snap 2trappy-darzinoo for discounted psychedelics which are the reason why I suffer from epsidoes of psychosis. What to take from all of this? Buy me Lego.
